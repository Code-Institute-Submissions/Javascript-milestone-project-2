Today, Route 66 is one of the most famous highways in the US travelling through 8 states; Chicago Illinois, through Missouri, Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona before ending in Santa Monica in Los Angeles County, California, covering a total of 2,448 miles.","    The route takes you from big cities, to small towns, and past some of the most obscure attractions in the country. Although places like Las Vegas and the Grand Canyon are not directly on the route, they are only a short drive away, and well worth the trip. Some of the most iconic things to see along the route are the buildings and signage of the numerous roadside cafes, motels, gas stations, and tourist attractions along this route. A large number of the original businesses are no longer operational, but in many places you can still eat in the same diner, sleep in the same motor court, and do a guided tour of the same cave as those who traveled Route 66 in the 1950â€™s.","    Spending time in the car, eating a hamburger and ice cream soda at a classic diner, visiting a fun classic tourist trap attraction, and sleeping in a simple but clean family-run motel are the hallmarks of a Route 66 trip.</p>","</div>","</div>"],"id":15}],[{"start":{"row":95,"column":18},"end":{"row":95,"column":19},"action":"remove","lines":["/"],"id":16},{"start":{"row":95,"column":17},"end":{"row":95,"column":18},"action":"remove","lines":["s"]},{"start":{"row":95,"column":16},"end":{"row":95,"column":17},"action":"remove","lines":["t"]},{"start":{"row":95,"column":15},"end":{"row":95,"column":16},"action":"remove","lines":["e"]},{"start":{"row":95,"column":14},"end":{"row":95,"column":15},"action":"remove","lines":["s"]},{"start":{"row":95,"column":13},"end":{"row":95,"column":14},"action":"remove","lines":["s"]},{"start":{"row":95,"column":12},"end":{"row":95,"column":13},"action":"remove","lines":["a"]}],[{"start":{"row":102,"column":18},"end":{"row":102,"column":19},"action":"remove","lines":["/"],"id":17},{"start":{"row":102,"column":17},"end":{"row":102,"column":18},"action":"remove","lines":["s"]},{"start":{"row":102,"column":16},"end":{"row":102,"column":17},"action":"remove","lines":["t"]},{"start":{"row":102,"column":15},"end":{"row":102,"column":16},"action":"remove","lines":["e"]},{"start":{"row":102,"column":14},"end":{"row":102,"column":15},"action":"remove","lines":["s"]},{"start":{"row":102,"column":13},"end":{"row":102,"column":14},"action":"remove","lines":["s"]},{"start":{"row":102,"column":12},"end":{"row":102,"column":13},"action":"remove","lines":["a"]}],[{"start":{"row":109,"column":18},"end":{"row":109,"column":19},"action":"remove","lines":["/"],"id":18},{"start":{"row":109,"column":17},"end":{"row":109,"column":18},"action":"remove","lines":["s"]},{"start":{"row":109,"column":16},"end":{"row":109,"column":17},"action":"remove","lines":["t"]},{"start":{"row":109,"column":15},"end":{"row":109,"column":16},"action":"remove","lines":["e"]},{"start":{"row":109,"column":14},"end":{"row":109,"column":15},"action":"remove","lines":["s"]},{"start":{"row":109,"column":13},"end":{"row":109,"column":14},"action":"remove","lines":["s"]},{"start":{"row":109,"column":12},"end":{"row":109,"column":13},"action":"remove","lines":["a"]}]]},"ace":{"folds":[],"scrolltop":943.3333740234375,"scrollleft":0,"selection":{"start":{"row":109,"column":12},"end":{"row":109,"column":12},"isBackwards":false},"options":{"guessTabSize":true,"useWrapMode":false,"wrapToView":true},"firstLineState":{"row":107,"state":"start","mode":"ace/mode/html"}},"timestamp":1573921894731,"hash":"e06a15da5ced2538be02a8962435c752281365bc"}
