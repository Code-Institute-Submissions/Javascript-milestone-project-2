## Project Name: Travel USA

TravelUSA is a travel company that specialises in bespoke travel packages which are made to each customer specifications. This website is a single page
website with Google Maps API. The map is designed as an exploratory feature to allow the user to look at different destinations all across the United States
and look at local attractions, places to eat as well as accomodation. The aim of having the map inbedded into the website is because the aim of TravelUSA
is for the customer to design their own holiday package, choose where they want to go, what they want to do, and TravelUSA takes care of the rest.


## UX:

Strategy:

From my own previous experience and from the research I conducted online, it is very hard to find a travel company that designs bespoke packages for each
customer. It is far more likely to find a travel company that offers ready made packages and the customer does not have much control over what is included
within this package. My friends, family and myself have had this problem many times and as a result it tends to be easier to plan and book holidays yourself.
I therefore decided there is a need for a travel company who allows the customer to have total control over their holiday package, but someone does the hard work
of booking and organsing it on their behalf. My aim was to create a simple, informative, modern and easy to use website.

Scope: 

The website is designed for people of any age or circumstances to find a holiday that is suitable for them i.e. a young couple, a retired couple, someone traveling alone
who wants to travel with a tour group and meet new people. The function of the map is for exploratory purposes to enable the user to be able to look at accomodation, restaurants and attractions
are available to help them design their holiday.

Structure:

- The website is a one page website.
- Navbar - sits at the top of the page and takes the user to the part of the page they wish to locate.
- The user is initially greeted with an image carousel of pictures of famous locations within the USA and the title of the company; TravelUSA.
- The user is then provided with some information about TravelUSA, what they do and what makes them different from other companies. To do this I used images
that when the user hovers over with the mouse, fades into a small paragraph of text.
- Google maps with buttons underneath for the user to filter by 'hotel', 'restaurants' and 'attractions'.
- Contact form to allow the user to input their query and submit it to the company.
- A footer that contains the social media links for TravelUSA.

For my second project, it was important to me that I used the constructive feedback from my last project to try to do even better on my second
project, and take the comments on board. I received feedback explaining that modern web design greatly enhances the user experience and I have tried
to ensure that the design and colour scheme are modern. To do this, I did alot of research on the design of current travel websites and looked at modern website design
templates to give me some ideas that could help me achieve this goal. As a Dyslexic myself, it is very important to me to make sure that the work I produce, now and during
my career as a developer always considers the needs of those who have learning disabilities as I know first hand the impact that font and use and colour can have on a persons' ability
to be able to read and process something. From the research I did, I noticed alot of web sites use alot of white as background colour and break up the page with bold colours. I also
noticed alot of modern websites are very "clean" looking such as whites, grays and blacks. I therefore decided to use the colours of the American flag, red, white and blue as I considered this appropriate given that
the website is about Travel in the USA. From the research I conducted on these colours; they have positive connotations for the user; red is considered energetic, warm and hard not to notice. 
Blue is considered a "safe choice" as is widely used and therefore likely to appeal to larger audience and white is considered neutral and has an association of peacefullness and serenity. 
Please see below links to just a few of the websites I used to do research on color schemes.

- "As a user I want to learn more TravelUSA, who they are and what they do and what makes them different to other travel companies".
- "As a user I want to know why I should choose them over other companies and can see that they have credability".
- "I want to come away from the website and understand what the aim of the website is."
- "I want the website to be easy to use and pleasant to look at."
- "As I user I want to see enough information to learn about the company, but not too much detail that I get bored of reading"
- "As a user I want to website to be broken up into easy to read sections but also to see it flow appropriately."
- "I want to look at links on the website without losing my place on the website itself."


## Features:

Overview:
•	Header
•	Footer
•	Responsive navbar
•	One page website:
    - Home
    - Plan your trip (the map)
    - Contact Us (takes the user to the contact form)
•	Images and image carousel

Header:
A large image of Harrison, which spreads across the width of the screen. This is the first thing the user will see when they arrive at the website.

Footer: 
Contains each of Harrison’s social links and the link to the petition.

Navbar: 
My navbar is a Bootstrap navbar which is mobile responsive, and collapses when you switch to a mobile or ipad device. I made each menu item into a circle which grows larger, changes colour and has a thin border, when you hover over them.

Home page:
Introduces Harrison and summarises what the website is for and what the aim of the campaign is. I used images to break up the page and spread the text, preventing it from looking too overcrowded.

About Me page:
Provides more detailed information about Harrison’s experience as a young presenter.  It also provides more information about the Mental Health Campaign. I used images to break up the page and spread out the text, preventing it from looking too overcrowded.

Speak Up page:
Provides statistics on depression, anxiety, self harm and suicide in children in the UK. This aim of this page is for children to understand that they are not alone, and provide links to mental health charities and helplines. The page also contains an image. The picture was found online (link provided in the ‘credits and media’ sections. Aside from the picture itself, I created the rest of the design myself. The aim of this image was to show common fears and worries that children have, and therefore how these worries can lead to mental health disorders.

Contact page:
This page is a simple form from Bootstrap which would allow the user to fill out their information and contact Harrison. This is for presenting opportunities, or for someone with an inspiring story to ask to join Harrison on his podcast.

Images:
I used a number of images throughout the website. Two images were taken from the internet (links found in the ‘credits’ and ‘media’ sections. All other images came directly from Harrison to show the user action shots of Harrison presenting at various events and conferences. 

## Features left to implement:
I would like to make the form on the ‘contact’ page, link to an email address. I would also like to be able to add videos or Harrison recording his podcast, or some more animation.

## Technologies used:
•	HTML5 - https://html.com/  
The use of HTML5 was a requirement for this project
•	CSS3 - http://www.css3.info/
The use of CC3 was a requirement for this project
•	Balsamiq wireframes - https://balsamiq.com/
My mentor suggesting using this wireframe programme to develop my project idea. I created wireframe for both the desktop and mobile
•	Bootstrap - https://getbootstrap.com/
I used bootstrap for a framework. I also used a navbar and contact form taken from Bootstrap
•	Font Awesome - https://fontawesome.com/
I used this on my “home page” and used an icon of a child instead of using bullet points. I used to make the page look more visually appealing.
•	Google Fonts - https://fonts.google.com/
I used a font taken from Google Fonts throughout my website. 


## Testing:
I tested the site continuously throughout the project. Each change, edit or development I made, I checked how this would function on a mobile device to ensure it looked how I wanted it to. I have tested each of the links to ensure that they work.
I used a HTML and CSS code validator to look through my code:  https://validator.w3.org/ and https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/. 
I tested my website on desktop, ipad and mobile devices. I also tested my website across different browsers including: Google Chrome, Internet Explorer and Modzilla.  
The bug challenges I faced throughout my project was ensuring my website was mobile responsive, however it is has been an excellent learning curve and I feel more confident in this area now. I attempted to solve bug problems in a number of different ways including; using Slack, reading about the topic on websites, watching videos on YouTube. I also had a lot of support from my mentor who helped me with a few challenges. 
One challenge in particular was to make my collapsed navbar work on a mobile device. I looked at a number of different resources online but seemed unable to resolve it. My mentor talked me through adding the Javascript link from Bootstrap into my code, and this would make my navbar responsive on a mobile device. 
The other bugs I encountered, I solved by trial and error. I found challenges with getting my margins and padding correct, as well as putting the right combination of colours together. I solved them by trial and error, until I felt satisfied.

## Deployment:
I used GitHub to deploy my code. I pushed my repository after I completed each task so ensure it was kept regularly up to date. I also pushed my repositories regularly because I wanted as much experience in using GitHub. 
My github repository for this project contains my files: index.html, general.html, contact.html, README.md and an “assets” file which contains my images and style.css.

How to locate my deployment:
1) Go to https://github.com/Leannald13/NEW-milestone-project
2) Go to the 'Settings' tab.
3) Scroll down the page to "Github Pages".
4) Select the link next to "Your website is published at"
5) Click:  https://leannald13.github.io/NEW-milestone-project/ 

## Media:
The images that I used came from Harrison. They were photos that were taken for him on his own camera while he took part in various events. The images were taken from his Instagram account.
The image of the children playing at the bottom of the each page was taken from: 
featurepic.com  "Group of Children Silhouettes Playing"
The illustation on "Speak Up" was a design Icreated myself, but the image of the child was taken from:
https://www.123rf.com/clipart-vector/sad_girl.html?sti=licwk294dqbytta4jc|

## Acknowledgements:
I recieved inspiration for this project from my nephew , who despite having Asperger’s Syndrome and ADHD and only 13 years of age, is already doing amazing work in the world. If I can use my skills as a developer for a good cause and contribute to the world in a positive way, then I believe it is a project worth doing.

## Credits:
•	My navbar, form and buttons were taken from Bootstrap.
•	 "About" page content was from Harrison, and I reworded it slightly. 
•	"Home” page statistics  were taken from: https://www.independent.co.uk/news/health/mental-health-children-nhs-england-depression-anxiety-report-young-people-a8646211.html
•	 "Speak Up” page statistics were taken from a number of different websites including: youngmind.org, anxietyuk.org, childrensociety.org, selfharm.co.uk, samaritans.org"
•	I used aspects of the code from my previous tutorial from The Code Institute where we created a resume website for someone by the name of Rosie. I used it for:
    o To create my font awesome icons on the "home" and "speak up" page and then I edited the code for my specifications.
    o I took the "logo" css code from the Rosie website for the main image at the top of the site and edited it to my specifications.
    o I used some of the code to create my form on the "Speak Up" page, and then amended the code for my specifications.

•	I watched YouTube videos by The Net Ninja: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW5YeuERMmlnqo4oq8vwUpg this developed my understanding of the bootstrap grid system.
