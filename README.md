##### Project Name: Travel USA

TravelUSA is a travel company that specialises in bespoke travel packages which are made to each customer specifications. This website is a single page
website with Google Maps API. The map is designed as an exploratory feature to allow the user to look at different destinations all across the United States
and look at local attractions, places to eat as well as accomodation. The aim of having the map inbedded into the website is because the aim of TravelUSA
is for the customer to design their own holiday package, choose where they want to go, what they want to do, and TravelUSA takes care of the rest.


### UX:

## Strategy:

From my own previous experience and from the research I conducted online, it is very hard to find a travel company that designs bespoke packages for each
customer. It is far more likely to find a travel company that offers ready made packages and the customer does not have much control over what is included
within this package. My friends, family and myself have had this problem many times and as a result it tends to be easier to plan and book holidays yourself.
I therefore decided there is a need for a travel company who allows the customer to have total control over their holiday package, but someone does the hard work
of booking and organsing it on their behalf. My aim was to create a simple, informative, modern and easy to use website.

## Scope: 

The website is designed for people of any age or circumstances to find a holiday that is suitable for them i.e. a young couple, a retired couple, someone traveling alone
who wants to travel with a tour group and meet new people. The function of the map is for exploratory purposes to enable the user to be able to look at accomodation, restaurants and attractions
are available to help them design their holiday.

## Structure:

• The website is a one page website.
• Navbar - sits at the top of the page and takes the user to the part of the page they wish to locate.
• The user is initially greeted with an image carousel of pictures of famous locations within the USA and the title of the company; TravelUSA.
• The user is then provided with some information about TravelUSA, what they do and what makes them different from other companies. To do this I used images
that when the user hovers over with the mouse, fades into a small paragraph of text.
• Google maps with buttons underneath for the user to filter by 'hotel', 'restaurants' and 'attractions'.
• Contact form to allow the user to input their query and submit it to the company.
• A footer that contains the social media links for TravelUSA.

## Surface: 

For my second project, it was important to me that I used the constructive feedback from my last project to try to do even better on my second
project, and take the comments on board. I received feedback explaining that modern web design greatly enhances the user experience and I have tried
to ensure that the design and colour scheme are modern. To do this, I did alot of research on the design of current travel websites and looked at modern website design
templates to give me some ideas that could help me achieve this goal. As a Dyslexic myself, it is very important to me to make sure that the work I produce, now and during
my career as a developer always considers the needs of those who have learning disabilities as I know first hand the impact that font and use and colour can have on a persons' ability
to be able to read and process something. From the research I did, I noticed alot of web sites use alot of white as background colour and break up the page with bold colours. I also
noticed alot of modern websites are very "clean" looking such as whites, grays and blacks. I therefore decided to use the colours of the American flag, red, white and blue as I considered this appropriate given that
the website is about Travel in the USA. From the research I conducted on these colours; they have positive connotations for the user; red is considered energetic, warm and hard not to notice. 
Blue is considered a "safe choice" as is widely used and therefore likely to appeal to larger audience and white is considered neutral and has an association of peacefullness and serenity. 
Please see below links to just a few of the websites I used to do research on color schemes.

https://www.crazyegg.com/blog/3-popular-colors-websites-use/
https://www.motocms.com/blog/en/white-use-in-web-design/

I also used a font that is popularly used and is a font that someone with learning disabilities finds easy to read, as well as using a suitable font size. I took information
from the British Association of Dyslexia website as a reference for font type, font size and colours: https://www.bdadyslexia.org.uk/advice/employers/creating-a-dyslexia-friendly-workplace/dyslexia-friendly-style-guide 

• "As a user I want to learn more TravelUSA, who they are and what they do and what makes them different to other travel companies".
• "As a user I want to know why I should choose them over other companies and can see that they have credability".
• "I want to come away from the website and understand what the aim of the website is."
• "I want the website to be easy to use and pleasant to look at."
• "As I user I want to see enough information to learn about the company, but not too much detail that I get bored of reading"
• "As a user I want to website to be broken up into easy to read sections but also to see it flow appropriately."
• "I want to look at links on the website without losing my place on the website itself."

I used bootstrap for a framework. I also used a navbar and contact form taken from Bootstrap

•	**Font Awesome - https://fontawesome.com/**
I used this on my “home page” and used an icon of a child instead of using bullet points. I used to make the page look more visually appealing.

•	**Google Fonts - https://fonts.google.com/**

### Testing:

## Testing Planning: 
To test the website continuously throughout the process of making the website. To have the website tested by other people of different ages to gain
their feedback on whether it is simple to use and informative. To run my code through validators to check that the code is accurate and of high quality.
To test my website on ipad and mobile device and to check my website on other browers; Chrome, internet explorer and Firefox.

## Testing on people:
I had members of my family test my website ranging from the age of 12 years old to 65 years old. All aspects of the website passed testing and
I took their feedback on board to make some amendments to the visual aspects on the page e.g. the original shade of blue that I chose was felt to be too
bright. I also had tutors from The Code Institute test my contact form to ensure it functioned correct. I asked my testers to do the following:

• Use the navigation bar and tell me where it takes you. Does it make sense to you that the navigation bar has taken you to that part of the web page?
• Search for any city in the USA. Does the map zoom? Do you think the map zooms in far enough?
• Select one of the buttoms at the bottom. Do you like the use of the USA map as a marker icon? Does the info box work when you click on the marker?
• Is the information on the info box easy to read? 
• Can you press on another button to and check that the markers clear before it finds new markers?
• Can you complete the contact form and so we can test if an email is received.


## Testing on ipad and mobile devices: 
This took alot of work and adjustment to have my website look the way I intended it to on these devices however
they now function effectively and visually appear the way I had intended them to.

## Testing through validators: 
My CSS passed first time, however my HTML initially came up with 10 errors which have now been fixed.

## Testing on different browsers: 
Testing passed.


### Deployment:
I used GitHub to deploy my code. I pushed my repository after I completed each task so ensure it was kept regularly up to date. I recieved feedback from my last project that my commit messages should be very clear and very specific and I have therefore
tried to ensure I have done this during this project.
My github repository for this project contains my files: index.html, style.css, script.js, sendEmail.js. There is also an images file which contains my images, my README.md file
and the PDF for my wireframes.

**How to locate my deployment:**
**1) Go to https://github.com/Leannald13/Javascript-milestone-project-2**
**2) Go to the 'Settings' tab.**
**3) Scroll down the page to "Github Pages".**
**4) Select the link next to "Your website is published at"**
**5) Click:  https://leannald13.github.io/Javascript-milestone-project-2/**

### Media:
The images that I used were all free images taken from Google searches for images of the USA and the USA flag.

### Acknowledgements:
I would firstly like to acknowledge my mentor Anthony Ngene who has been a huge support for my projects. I would also like to acknowledge and thank 
members of the Code Institute for their help during this project in particular Tim who has helped resolve some big challenges I was having with my Javascript.
